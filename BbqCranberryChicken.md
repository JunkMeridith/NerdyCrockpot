BBQ Cranberry Chicken
==================

### What you'll need

- **2 lbs** boneless chicken breasts
- **1/4 cup** dried minced onion
 - You'll find this by the spices, most likely in the baking aisle
- **1** (16 oz.) can whole cranberry sauce 
 - note: not *jellied* cranberry sauce
 - although jellied will work fine too, if you're in a pinch
- **1 cup** BBQ sauce
 - I don't bother measuring out a cup - I just buy a smaller bottle and dump the whole thing in

### What you'll do

1. Combine all ingredients into crockpot.
1. Cook on high for 3 - 4 hours or low for 6 - 7 hours.

### Other stuff

- Serve on buns.  Or not, if that's what you're into.
- [Some people say you should thaw your chicken breasts before putting them in the crockpot.](http://www.twohealthykitchens.com/2014/02/03/is-it-safe-to-use-frozen-meat-in-your-crock-pot/)  I think that's way too much work.
