# A Cider Punch

A hot, cider-based, slightly alcoholic punch. Makes about 10 servings.

## Get these
- 6 cups of Apple Cider (not hard cider, the stuff that comes in gallon jugs or if you are super ambitious, you could make it yourself)
- 1 cup of Cranberry Juice
- 1 cup of Orange Juice
- 1 cup of Pineapple Juice
- 6 Cloves
- 4 Cinnamon Sticks
- 8 fluid ounces of Overproof Rum (and/or bourbon whiskey)

## Do this
1. Put all ingredients except for the rum in the crockpot.
1. Set the crockpot to low or medium and secure the lid.
1. Wait for at least 2 hours.
	- More than 6 hours is overkill.

## Deployment
- Turn off the heat.
- Add the rum.
	- Optionally add more booze. (as administrator)
- Deploy immediately to mugs.
	- Optionally add more booze. (per user install)
